# Wine Quality Prediction with RNN (TensorFlow)

Predicts wine quality from taster descriptions using an RNN model with LSTM layers in TensorFlow.
- Text classification based on wine tasting notes.
- Preprocessing: tokenization, padding, embeddings.
- Model: Embedding → LSTM → Dense output.
- Built with TensorFlow and Scikit-learn for evaluation.
- Tuned model to achieve 84% accuracy on test data.
